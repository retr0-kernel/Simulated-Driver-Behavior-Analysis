# Simulated Driver Behavior Analysis

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Background 
The dataset under consideration is aimed at classifying different driver behaviors and extracting driver patterns. The data was collected using the Carla Simulator platform, and it includes information from a 6-axis virtual IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor installed on a "Seat Leon" vehicle. The collected data encompasses the driving behaviors of seven distinct drivers on a predefined route with multiple turns.

### 1.2 Objective
The primary objective of this dataset is to analyze driver behavior and discern patterns that could have practical applications in areas such as autonomous vehicle development, driver monitoring systems, and road safety.

## 2. Data Collection
### 2.1 Data Source
The data was collected using a customized data collector environment within the Carla Simulator. The simulation environment is based on the "Town03" map, and the data is generated by simulating driving scenarios with a "Seat Leon" car model.

### 2.2 Sensor Information
The dataset includes information from a 6-axis virtual IMU sensor, which provides measurements from a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. These sensors capture crucial information about the vehicle's motion and orientation during the simulated drives.

## 3. Dataset Description
### 3.1 Features
The dataset contains the following features:
 - <b>Driver Names:</b> The "class" column, which includes the names of the seven different drivers: [mehdi, apo, gonca, onder, berk, selin, hurcan].
 - <b>IMU Data:</b> The dataset includes measurements from the 6-axis IMU sensor, including accelerometer and gyroscope data, which can be further broken down into specific data points, such as acceleration along the x, y, and z axes, and angular velocities around the x, y, and z axes.
 - <b>Path Information:</b> The dataset records the path taken by the vehicle, including details about turns and other maneuvers.
