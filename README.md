# Simulated Driver Behavior Analysis

## 1.1 Background 
The dataset under consideration is aimed at classifying different driver behaviors and extracting driver patterns. The data was collected using the Carla Simulator platform, and it includes information from a 6-axis virtual IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensor installed on a "Seat Leon" vehicle. The collected data encompasses the driving behaviors of seven distinct drivers on a predefined route with multiple turns.
